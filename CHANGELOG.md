## v0.8.1
* Fix: Space in jar name doesn't cause error anymore

## v0.8.0
* Feat: Add support for java-9 and java-10. Fix colours for themes.
    * Previously, the tool worked only with java-8. Now it also functions
    with java-9 and 10.
    Additionally, some theme and colour combinations
    in Atom didn't work out (i.e. white colour on white background), so
    some colours were adjusted with the aim to be more easily readable.

## 0.1.0 - First Release
* Every feature added
* Every bug fixed
